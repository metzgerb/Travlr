# Travlr
Web application for planning trips

Installation & Local Testing/Debugging Set Up Instructions:
1. (npm must be installed) open a command line or terminal
2. npm -g install ionic (installs ionic which is the framework running this AngularJs app)
3. extract the Travlr folder or the dbinterface folder to your preferred location (use Travlr for the app, or dbinterface to view/modify/delete the database records only)
4. cd to the root of that directory
5. run "ionic serve" from the root of the directory(This may ask to install @angular/cli, choose Y to install)
6. When it finishes installing, ionic should set up a local server for testing and debugging which can be viewed at http://localhost:8100 by default (I also believe it launches a web browser for that URL automatically)
7. To terminate the app you can close the CLI or terminal window or use a interrupt signal (CTRL + C on windows) a couple times to get a prompt for terminating the batch process (which you can say Y to in order to close it out)
